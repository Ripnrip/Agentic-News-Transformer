Goals
- Integrate lipsync bimbos
- Test dockerize container to azure
- Run at least the NewsAgent ~3-5 times a day 
- Output maybe a hot mail letter internally for daily SCOOOP
- Potentially add another agent for content moderation or QA/QE prior to further analysis (in the report or generation steps)
- DYnamic content gathering from various better sources like maybe a linkdin feed or specific AI influencers, beyond datascience
- The above Step should have a HITL(Human In The Loop) step for quality gating and also maybe RLHF (Reinforcment learning with human feedback) thumbs up/down
- For internal / debug, we should be able to add sources easily from human input
