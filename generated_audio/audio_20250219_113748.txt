Next, we have some exciting news from Google Pay. They're about to turn the digital payment scene on its head by introducing AI-powered voice commands for UPI payments. Imagine this: all you need to do is express your command, and Google Pay does the rest. It's like having your very own financial assistant, always at your service. This development is not just cool, but it's a crucial stride towards making technology more accessible and inclusive for everyone.

But now, let's shift to a slightly bitter note. We all love sugar, but often avoid it for health reasons, right? Well, it turns out that not all substitutes are as safe as we thought. A recent study from Sweden reveals that a popular artificial sweetener may increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. This is a significant discovery, as many of us often turn to artificial sweeteners as a healthier alternative to sugar. But don't worry, this only underscores the need for more research and better alternatives.
