Next, we bring you an exciting scoop from Google Pay. They're set to revolutionize the digital payment landscape with AI-powered voice commands for UPI payments. Imagine just whispering your command, and Google Pay does the rest. It's like having your own personal financial assistant, always at your service.

[SPEAKER 2]
That's not just cool, it's a significant move towards making technology more accessible and inclusive.

Now, we're shifting gears to a slightly bitter note. A recent study from Sweden has revealed that a popular artificial sweetener can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. We often turn to such alternatives as a healthier choice to sugar, but it seems we need to be more cautious.

[SPEAKER 2]
Indeed, this finding underscores the need for more research and better alternatives.
