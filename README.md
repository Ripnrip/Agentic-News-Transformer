# Agentic Content Transformer - Code Optimization

This repository contains updates to the Agentic Content Transformer application to optimize the codebase and improve user experience.

## Key Improvements

1. **Unified App Interface**: Consolidated two separate UI modes into a single application with a mode selector
2. **Application Performance**: Enhanced script processing and error handling
3. **Docker Support**: Improved Dockerfile and deployment scripts
4. **Run Scripts**: Added convenient scripts for running the application in different environments

## Run Scripts

- `run-local.sh`: Run the application locally with environment variables
- `run-docker.sh`: Run the application in a Docker container
- `run-unified.sh`: Run the unified application with both modes accessible

## Todo

See the [TODO.md](TODO.md) file for planned code optimizations and improvements.
